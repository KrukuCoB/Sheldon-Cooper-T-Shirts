    <description>This simple mod, although it does not add the character of the TV series "The Big Bang Theory" Sheldon Cooper to the game, but allows your pawns to try on his skin, in part.

Added 8 most memorable T-shirts, each of which affects some characteristics of the pawn.

+ research speed - because it's a Sheldon Cooper T-shirt.
+ social impact - because it's a Sheldon Cooper T-shirt.
- negotiation ability - I hope there is no need to explain why.

The mod can be added and removed at any stage of the game.
